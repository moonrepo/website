The **Workspace** is the foundational concept in moon that serves as the central coordination point for all operations within your codebase. It represents a directory containing multiple projects, manages toolchains, executes tasks, and integrates tightly with version control systems (VCS). The workspace is the top-level organizational unit that enables moon's powerful monorepo management capabilities.

## Key characteristics

A workspace in moon is identified by the presence of a `.moon` directory within your repository, typically at the root. This directory contains all workspace-level configuration and serves as the anchor point for moon's project discovery, task execution, and caching mechanisms.

- **Monorepo-first design** - Optimized for managing multiple related projects in a single repository.
- **Automatic project discovery** - Uses glob patterns or explicit mappings to locate projects.
- **Centralized configuration** - Workspace-level settings that cascade down to projects.
- **Dependency graph management** - Creates and maintains project and task dependency relationships.
- **Intelligent caching** - Content-based hashing and caching for optimal performance.
- **VCS integration** - Deep integration with Git for change detection, file hashing, and more.
